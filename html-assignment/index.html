            </header>
            <p>My name is Feyza and, I am 22 years old. I came from Turkey three months ago to study at
            <abbr title = "Algonquin College">AC</abbr> . Currently, I live in Ottawa. I have studied graphic design for one year 
            before. This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> post-secondary degree attempt. I hope I can graduate with success 
            this time.</p>
            <p>I like drawing various things and reading books about psychology as a hobby. I hope to 
            learn about designing and building websites in this program. I am enjoying the process 
            so far and can’t wait to learn more! I haven’t decided what I want to do in the future, 
            but there is a crazy part inside of me that wants to study more, maybe psychology.</p>
