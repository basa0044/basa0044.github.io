        <h1>LIST OF SOME HTML TAGS</h1>
    </header>
    <article>

        <p>My favorite ones in order:</p>

        <dl>

            <dt> < a > < / a > anchor tag  </dt>
            <dd> This is the most fun tag so far, basically allows you to link any stuff to your page from the web. <nav> <a href="index.html" >LIKE THIS! </a> </nav> </dd>

            <dt> < img > image tag </dt>
            <dd> This is the one I used, to show my cat's photo on my page. Shouldn't forget to use it with src and alt attributes though.(Single tags count, right?) </dd>

            <dt> < p > < / p > Pharagraph Tag </dt>
            <dd> I like it cuz it's simple and probably carries most of the content inside. </dd>

            <dt> < article > < / article > Article Tag </dt>
            <dd> Seperates different pieces of contents in your website. </dd>

            <dt> < h1 > < / h1 > Heading size Tags</dt>
            <dd> How did I forget this one? <h2>I am trying to create</h2> <h3>a stair of words</h3> <h4>with using this</h4> <h5>tags now</h5> <h6>.</h6> end of the description.</dd>

        </dl>

        <p> NOTE: I couldn't validate my code, the website in the link didn't work for me. The circle just kept rolling and it said "this site cannot be reached" at the end. I am not sure it is only me? </p>
